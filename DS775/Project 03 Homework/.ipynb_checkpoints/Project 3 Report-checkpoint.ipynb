We'll do this by revisiting the scheduling problem from Lesson 7. But, we're going to make it a little more true-to-life by acknowledging some of the uncertainty in our estimates, and using simulation to help us come up with better estimates. We'll use our estimated profits to construct a payoff table and make a decision about how to proceed with the building project.\n",

When special artifacts are found, the excavation phase takes considerably longer and the entire project costs more - sometimes much more. They're never quite sure how much longer it will take, but it peaks around an extra 15 days, and takes at least an extra 7 days. They've seen some sites where relocating the special artifacts took as much as 365 extra days (yes - a whole year)! \n",

    "Clearly dealing with artifacts can be very costly for Reliable Construction.  It is known from past experience that about 30% of building sites in this area contain special artifacts.  Fortunately, they can purchase an insurance policy - a quite expensive insurance policy. The insurance policy costs \\$500000, but it covers all fines and penalities for delays in the event that special artifacts are found that require remediation. Effectively, this means that Reliable could expect the same profit they would get if no artifacts were found (minus the cost of the policy).\n",
