It is known from past experience that about 30% of building sites in this area contain special artifacts.  Fortunately, they can purchase an insurance policy - a quite expensive insurance policy. The insurance policy costs \\$500000, but it covers all fines and penalities for delays in the event that special artifacts are found that require remediation. Effectively, this means that Reliable could expect the same profit they would get if no artifacts were found (minus the cost of the policy).\n\nGiven the estimated profit without artifacts, the estimated profit with artifacts, the cost of insurance, the 30% likelihood of finding artifacts, create a payoff table and use Baye's Decision Rule to determine what decision Reliable should make.
