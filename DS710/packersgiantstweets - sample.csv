"#GBvsNYG Dreadful. Top to bottom. 

#Packers went 7-13 on 3rd down and 1-1 on 4th. Young secondary struggled and no pass rush again. 

Jones showed some flashes of being the guy but 3 INTs just can’t happen. @saquon looked healthier and his pass protection improved.

My 2¢ on the game. The second half @packers looked a little more cohesive. The ST looked 💯% better today. The lack of communication in our backfield is embarrassing and really needs some discipline.

Best offensive play against the @Giants is to throw the ball down field and have your receiver throw up his hands to draw the interference call.  3rd and long is not an advantage for that Defense.

#GBvsNYG @packers better figure out how to be a dominant team with what they have as their record assures them of a bad draft spot already. The defense is lost and much slower than in the early season unlike SF which smoked the Pack with speed. Do the packers do sprint drills?,1201236174645399553,2019-12-01 20:26:36,10731052,bish

"Sure, #NYGiants put 12 men on the field, Aaron Rodgers will still find his man. A healthy @tae15adams in December is a dangerous thing! 2 touchdown grabs- 1st multi TD game since WK 10 of 2018 against the #Dolphins. #Packers #GBvsNYG #NFLSunday",1201234615073198082,2019-12-01 20:20:24,83684326,Josh Moser

I can't believe the refs made the Giants put 12 men on the field #GBvsNYG,1201234531367505923,2019-12-01 20:20:04,3960679753,Jay Owen
12 guys on the field and we still can't prevent a TD. There is a lack of leadership on this defense. Lack of veteran presence. We scare no one. #GBvsNYG @Giants #GiantsPride,1201234520705552385,2019-12-01 20:20:02,250713306,EST. 1925
