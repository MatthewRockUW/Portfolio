# Matt Rock Data Science Portfolio
 
This is a selection of data science-related projects I am particularly proud of.

## University of Wisconsin Masters of Data Science
I am currently taking one class a semester, scheduled to complete the course in May of 2023. Here's some highlights of my work, linking to their Github directory.

### [DS705 Final Project - Loan Classification](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Portfolio/tree/master/DS705/Project)
The stats final project involved using regression algorithems and data cleansing to identify if a loan would succeed or fail. I'm proud of the details I wove into the executive narritive and the technical writing, 
like highlighting the credit card question simplifying the loan process and referencing the 2008 financial crash. 

### [DS710 Final Project - NFL Tweets](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Portfolio/tree/master/DS710)
I used Twitter's API to look up NFL teams hashtag usage during games. I didn't have great control of R's graphing yet, so I punted on displaying tweet usage by minute. 

### [DS730 Final](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Portfolio/tree/master/DS730/FinalProject)
A mish-mash of college football win streaks. 

### [DS760 Final Paper - Fake Names](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Portfolio/blob/master/DS760/Fake%20Names.md)
A deep dive into online verification of identities. Written in Summer 2020. 

## Bucky's 5th Quarter Writing
I write data-driven stories about college athletics, focusing on the University of Wisconsin. Here are some highlights, linking to their posts at B5Q and any Github repository for the spreadsheets & scripts I may have used as source material. 

### [Nemesis!](https://www.sbnation.com/e/20726511)
My favorite B5Q article. I create a brand new statistic to talk about college football through the eyes of Wisconsin running backs stomping over their conference foes. 

I had other [articles about Taylor](https://www.buckys5thquarter.com/2019/9/12/20860105/wisconsin-badgers-football-jonathan-taylor-is-very-good-at-football-records-ron-dayne-melvin-gordon), but this is the one I have on my LinkedIn page.

### [The 1970’s Big 10 Wikipedia Entries Were Mostly Written By A Michigan Man](https://www.sbnation.com/e/21110152)
Data science involves [cleansing and formatting existing data into something you can more easily manage](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Portfolio/tree/master/1970%20Big%2010%20Football). I noticed that Michigan was talked about a lot in the Big 10's wiki pages, and met Cbl62.

#### [Wisconsin’s place in Women’s Soccer](https://www.sbnation.com/e/21166001)
#### [Wisconsin’s place in Badminton and Billiards](https://www.sbnation.com/e/21199042)
#### [Wisconsin’s place in Men’s Indoor Track & Field](https://www.buckys5thquarter.com/2020/8/9/21360221/wisconsins-badgers-place-in-mens-indoor-track-and-field-morgan-mcdonald-nebraska-michigan)
When there were no sports due to COVID19, [I scraped PDF's to look at non-revenue sports history](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Portfolio/tree/master/conference%20history) and how Wisconsin had fared. 

### [University of Illinois Announces Massive Stimulus Program for Midwestern Bars](https://www.sbnation.com/e/21954439)
I am paid to write at Bucky's Fifth Quarter. 

## Hobby Projects
### [Wellness App](https://github.com/MatthewRockUW/Health) 
I used to play around with Ruby on Rails, and got a neat little web app that tracked calories, macros, and graded a user based on how they hit their benchmarks, but I upgraded a dependency and broke something. It's from years ago, but at shows some familiarity with version control. Not enough, if it's still broken.
